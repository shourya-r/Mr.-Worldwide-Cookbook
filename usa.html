        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 Ribeye Steak, 2 inch thick</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Canola Oil</li>
            <li>3 Cloves Garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>2 Sprigs Fresh Rosemary</li>
            <li>3 Sprigs Fresh Thyme</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200°F (95°C). Set a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Generously season the steak on all sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer the steak to the wire rack, then bake for 45–60 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches about 125°F (51°C) for medium-rare, or your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Heat the canola oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat until smoking. (Do not use olive oil, as its smoke point is significantly lower than that of canola oil and will smoke before reaching the desired cooking temperature.)</li>
            <li>Sear the steak for 30 seconds on the first side, then flip. Add the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme and swirl around the pan. Place the garlic and herbs on top of the steak and baste the steak with the butter using a large spoon for about 30 seconds, then flip and baste the other side for about 15 seconds. Turn the steak on its side to render off any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Transfer the steak to a cutting board or wire rack to rest for about 10 minutes. (Slicing the steak before the resting period has finished will result in a lot of the juices leaking out, which may not be desirable.)</li>
            <li>Slice the steak into ½-inch (1-cm) strips, then fan out the slices and serve.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
